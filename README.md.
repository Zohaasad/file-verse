# OFS – Omni File Server

**OFS** is a multi-user, TCP-based file server providing a virtual filesystem interface. It allows clients to manage files and directories, perform read/write operations, and view file metadata securely through a session-based system. The client interface is terminal-based, using a menu-driven UI.

---

## Features

- Multi-user authentication with `admin` and `normal` roles.
- File operations: create, read, edit, delete, rename, truncate.
- Directory operations: create, list, delete.
- Session management and permissions enforcement.
- JSON-based protocol for structured communication.
- Multi-threaded server for handling concurrent connections.
- Terminal-based client with intuitive navigation and input.

---

## System Requirements

- Linux or macOS.
- C++17 compiler (e.g., g++).
- Python 3.8+ (for terminal client).
- Network access between client and server.
- Precompiled files:
  - `compiled/sample.omni`
  - `compiled/default.uconf`

---

## Installation & Build

### 1. Compile the server

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 server/server.cpp server/main_server.cpp -pthread -o ofs_server
2. Ensure configuration files exist
compiled/sample.omni
compiled/default.uconf
These files contain filesystem definitions and server configuration.
3. Start the server
./ofs_server
Server starts listening on the default port 8080.
Configuration options (port, max_connections, queue_timeout) can be set in default.uconf.
4. Run the terminal client
python3 ui/ofs_terminal_ui.py
Connects to the server on the default host and port.
Displays a login prompt. Enter your credentials to access the file server.
Usage Notes
Navigation: Use arrow keys to move, Enter to select, Esc to cancel or go back.
Admin privileges: Required for user management and permission changes.
JSON responses: All server responses follow a structured JSON format:
{
  "status": "success",
  "operation": "read_file",
  "request_id": "0",
  "error_message": "",
  "data": "File content here"
}
Error handling: Operations include descriptive error messages in error_message if a failure occurs.
Quick Start Example
Start server:
./ofs_server
Launch client:
python3 ui/ofs_terminal_ui.py
Login:
Username: admin
Password: password123
